# About Our Travel Journey

Welcome to our travel blog! We’re passionate travelers who believe that the best journeys are slow, meaningful, and deeply connected to nature and local life.

## Our Mission

This blog is dedicated to sharing genuine, unfiltered travel experiences from our journeys around the world. Our goal is to help fellow travelers make informed decisions through honest reviews, practical planning tips, and real-life insights — without the gloss of packaged tours or over-commercialized experiences.

## Our Travel Philosophy

Travel, for us, is not about ticking off attractions — it’s about *feeling* a place.

We strongly believe in:
- **Nature-first travel** — beaches, forests, mountains, and open landscapes over man-made attractions
- **Slow travel** — spending time, not rushing through itineraries
- **Living like a local** — understanding everyday life, culture, and traditions

We consciously avoid crowded tourist hotspots and overly commercial activities. Instead, we seek calm, less-explored places where we can truly unwind and connect with the surroundings.

## How We Travel

We don’t believe in packaged or group tours.

Every trip we take is:
- Carefully researched and self-planned
- Flights and accommodations booked independently
- Itineraries designed with flexibility, not rigid schedules

This approach allows us to travel at our own pace and discover places beyond typical tourist routes.

## Food & Local Experiences

Food plays a huge role in how we experience a destination.

- We love exploring **local cuisine** and authentic, everyday restaurants  
- We prefer eating what locals eat, where locals eat  
- We usually avoid our cuisine (Indian) while traveling abroad  
- We’re especially fond of **Asian cuisine** and love discovering regional variations across countries  

Through food, we feel closer to the culture and rhythm of daily life in each place we visit.

Each destination we explored has shaped our perspective, taught us something new, and reinforced our belief that travel is best experienced slowly, authentically, and mindfully.

## Why This Blog

This blog is our way of documenting our journeys and sharing what we learn along the way — the good, the bad, and the unexpected. If you love nature, peaceful travel, authentic food, and independent exploration, you’ll feel right at home here.

Thanks for being part of our journey
