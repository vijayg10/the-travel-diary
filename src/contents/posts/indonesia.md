# Indonesia - Beyond Bali

Indonesia offers incredible beach destinations, but here's the insider tip: don't stop at Bali! While Bali has its charm, the real natural beauty lies in Lombok and the Gili Islands.

## The Bali Reality

Bali has become heavily westernized over the years, and unfortunately, nature preservation hasn't kept pace with tourism development. The beaches are crowded, and much of the authentic Indonesian experience has been lost to commercialization.

### Our Recommendation for Bali

Spend just **2-3 days in Bali** to see the main attractions, then move on to where the real magic happens.

## Lombok & Gili Islands - The Hidden Gems

This is where Indonesia truly shines! Lombok and the Gili Islands offer everything Bali promised but couldn't deliver.

### Why Lombok & Gili are Better

- **Preserved Nature**: Beaches and landscapes remain largely untouched
- **Authentic Experience**: Less commercialized, more genuine Indonesian culture
- **Pristine Waters**: Crystal-clear seas perfect for swimming and snorkeling
- **Peaceful Atmosphere**: Away from the crowds of Bali
- **Natural Beauty**: Stunning landscapes that haven't been overdeveloped

## Our Travel Plan

1. **Days 1-3**: Explore Bali's main attractions
2. **Days 4+**: Head to Lombok and Gili Islands for the real Indonesian experience

## Overall Experience

Indonesia is definitely worth visiting, but make sure you venture beyond Bali. The real treasures of Indonesia lie in Lombok and the Gili Islands, where nature is still preserved and the beaches remain pristine.

**Our Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐**

*Must visit Lombok and Gili Islands - don't make the mistake of staying only in Bali!*
