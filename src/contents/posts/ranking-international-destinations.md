# Ranking for International Destinations

After 15 years of exploring the world, we've compiled our honest ranking of the international destinations we've visited. This ranking reflects our personal experiences and what we value most in travel - authentic experiences, natural beauty, and family-friendly environments.

## 1. Maldives ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Best beach destination undoubtedly.**

The Maldives takes the top spot without question. It offers:

- **Turquoise color water** that looks unreal even without filters
- **White sand beaches** that are pristine and powdery soft
- **Mesmerizing underwater life** - the best untouched coral reefs for snorkeling

If you're looking for the ultimate beach paradise, nothing beats the Maldives.

## 2. Singapore and Kuala Lumpur ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**City life and man-made wonders.**

These cities showcase modern Asia at its finest:

- **Skyscrapers** that define impressive skylines
- **Amusement parks** with world-class attractions
- Perfect blend of development and culture
- Clean, organized, and efficient

Great for those who love urban exploration and modern architecture.

## 3. Indonesia - Bali, Lombok and Gili Islands ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Another beach destination, but with an important caveat.**

### Our Strong Recommendation:

**Do not stop at Bali. Must visit Lombok and Gili Islands.**

Here's why:
- Bali has become **westernized**
- Nature is **not preserved well** in Bali
- Too commercialized and crowded

### The Better Plan:
- Spend just **2-3 days in Bali** for the main attractions
- Then move to **Lombok and Gili Islands** where the real Indonesian beauty remains

The preserved nature and authentic experience in Lombok and Gili Islands make Indonesia worth visiting.

## 4. Taiwan ⭐⭐⭐½

**Cuisine and lifestyle destination.**

We liked Taiwan primarily due to:
- **Exceptional cuisine** - the food scene is phenomenal
- **Unique lifestyle** - interesting cultural experiences
- Some scenic places

However, we're **not sure if we can recommend it for others** over the other destinations on this list. It's great for food lovers, but may not be the best choice if you're seeking dramatic landscapes or beach experiences.

## 5. Mauritius ⭐⭐½

**Nice beaches, but not worth it.**

Mauritius has nice beaches, but:
- We feel it's **not better than Maldives**
- **Not worth** the journey when compared to other options
- Lacks the "wow" factor

If you're choosing between Mauritius and Maldives, go to Maldives without hesitation.

## 6. Thailand ⭐⭐

**Not suitable for families.**

### Our Concerns:

The popular places like **Pattaya and Phuket** have significant issues:
- **Overly crowded**
- Strong **pub culture** dominates the atmosphere
- Not family-friendly

### A Note of Hope:

Maybe the other side of Thailand has some suitable places, but we can only speak to what we've experienced. The popular tourist spots are not recommended for family travel.
