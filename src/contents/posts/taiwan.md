## Scenic Places

Taiwan does have some scenic spots, but we're not entirely sure if we would recommend it over other destinations purely for natural beauty. The landscapes are pleasant, but may not be as dramatic as other places on our list.

## Our Honest Take

We enjoyed Taiwan primarily for its food and cultural experience rather than as a nature or beach destination. If you're a food enthusiast or interested in experiencing a different Asian lifestyle, Taiwan is definitely worth a visit.

However, if your main priority is beaches, dramatic landscapes, or outdoor adventures, you might want to prioritize other destinations from our list.

**Our Rating: ⭐⭐⭐½**

*Perfect for food lovers and culture enthusiasts, but may not be the top choice for nature seekers!*
